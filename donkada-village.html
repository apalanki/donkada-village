                        <h2>Donkada Village Profile</h2>
                        <span class="byline">Donkada is about 12kms away from Tuni</span>
                    </header>
                    <p>It is this saying from the Kali’s child that tickled a thought in my mind back in 2004 to start and do something to people who needed some “Cheyutha”.
                        It was good time enough to meet some like-minded people in Sarma garu of Tuni who is a teacher in commerce. A guide to many and a seeker.
                        He is intimated with surrounding villages and can identify the needs of the selected villages with the support of respective village locals.</p>

                    <p>It was through him did we get to know about Donkada a village, Nakkapalli Mandal, Vizag dist.
                        It is surrounded mainly by agricultural lands and people engaged in agro related activities, with lush green all over situated 12 KM away from Tuni.</p>

                    <p>Donkada is a Third and end village about 4km. from National Highway. The village population is about 4500 with 500 houses.
                        People of this village are very good, obedient and of hardworking. Children of this village help their parents in agriculture and go for studies.
                        Parents support education, therefore, a much student-force can be found in this village.</p>

                    <div style="text-align: center">
                        <div class="image">
                            <img src="images/donkada_village.jpg">
                        </div>
                        <p>Birds eye view of the village</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>As we got to know more about the land of “Annadaata’s” we were moved by the issues plaguing the very core and the existence of people.</p>

                    <p>Due to its geographical location its underground water has excess fluorine content making it impossible for consumption.
                        The transportation facilities to the main road are almost zero making life difficult to college going children, mainly the girls.
                        The scheme "Gadadhar Abhyuday Prakalpa" was almost like a helping hand to many children of the village before it was stopped due to unavailability of funds.
                        The financial condition of the parents in the village would deny their children graduation or post-graduation studies making them impossible to dream of a worthy life.</p>

                    <p>The various programs we launched and are promoting are to make this village self sustainable and help the next generation dream big and achieve these goals</p>
